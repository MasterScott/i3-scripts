i3-scripts
==========

In my early Linux days, I loved using Blackbox and later Fluxbox as my window managers, but quickly I became a big supporter of tiling window managers like dwm, wmii, xmonad or i3.

I have being so dependant on these kind of Window managers that I cannot switch back to the "normal" ones like gnome or kde.

I was a wmii user for a long time but I changed to i3 window manager a couple of years ago, mainly because i3 is an active project, well documented, implementing multi-monitor correctly and also due to the fact that I started enhancing wmii with some scripts/frameworks that were not maintained and far to be compatible with the last wmii releases (the old https://web.archive.org/web/20081227225803/http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?wmii+ruby and then https://github.com/sunaku/wmiirc).

But I got so used to wmii that I was missing some of its functionality in i3, that's why I wrote these scripts for the i3 windows manager (https://i3wm.org/), trying to mimic the way that I was working before.

Hoping they are useful for someone too.
